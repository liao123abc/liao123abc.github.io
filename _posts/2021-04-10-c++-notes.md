# c++ Notes

## 1.0.0 编译器
- msvc
    - windows
    - 最历史悠久、最成熟，但也是最有历史包袱的编译器，微软
    - 模板的支持则是它的软肋
    - 2018 年宣布已全面支持 C++17 标准

- gcc
    - 跨平台
    - GCC 的第一个版本发布于 1987 年，是由自由软件运动的发起人 Richard Stallman（常常被缩写为 RMS）亲自写的
    - 由于 GCC 是用 GPL 发布的，任何对 GCC 的修改都必须以 GPL 协议发布
    - 应用最广的自由软件之一

- clang
    - 跨平台
    - 错误信息的友好性是它的最大亮点
    - 最新， LLVM项目的一部分
    - Clang 目前在 macOS 下是默认的 C/C++ 编译器


## 1.0.1 内联函数
- 如果一些函数被频繁调用，不断地有函数入栈，即函数栈，会造成栈空间或栈内存的大量消耗
- 关键字inline 必须与函数定义体放在一起才能使函数成为内联，仅将inline 放在函数声明前面不起任何作用
- inline只适合涵数体内代码简单的函数数使用，不能包含复杂的结构控制语句例如while、switch，并且内联函数本身不能是直接递归函数(自己内部还调用自己的函数)。
- 内联是以代码膨胀（复制）为代价，仅仅省去了函数调用的开销，从而提高函数的执行效率
- 最好将内联函数定义放在头文件中


## 1.0.2 macro
- #define 预处理指令用于创建符号常量：#define PI 3.14159
    - #define 来定义一个带有参数的宏，注意要多加括号：MIN(a,b) (a<b ? a : b)
- 条件编译：#ifdef #define #endif
- “#”置于identifier面前表示将identifier变成字符串字面值，“##”连接

## 1.0.3 array

```c++
unsigned cnt = 42;
constexpr unsigned sz = 42;

int arr[10];
//if you don't know how many elements you want, use a vector
int *parr[sz];

const unsigned size = 3;
int ia1[size] = {0, 1, 2};
int a2[] = {0, 1, 2};
int a3[5] = {0, 1, 2};
string a4[4] = {"hi", "bye"}; // remember #include <string>
string Animals[4] = {"Elephant", "Fox", "Lion", "Tiger"}; // remember #include <string>
//char array is special
char a1[] = {'C', '+', '+'}; //list initialization, no null;
CHECK_V(sizeof(a1) == 3)
char a22[] = {'C', '+', '+', '\0'}; //list initialization, explicit null
CHECK_V(sizeof(a22) == 4)
char a33[] = "C++"; //null terminator added automatically
CHECK_V(sizeof(a33) == 4)
const char a44[7] = "Daniel";
```

### 无法通过变量来声明数组大小
ex:

```c++
int state[max] = {0};
```

- You can declare an array only with constant size, which can be deduced at compile time. 
variables' values can be known only at runtime.
- To elaborate, when you allocate memory on the stack, the size must be known at compile time. 
Since the arrays are local to the method, they will be placed on the stack. 



#### solution1:
- You can either use constant value, or allocate memory in the heap using new,
 and deallocate when done using delete, like

```c++
    int* zod1 = new int[zo1];
//.... other code
    delete[] zod1;
```

#### solution2:
- use vector instead of array here also, and vector will take care of allocation on the heap.
- As a side note, you should not pass vector by value, as the whole vector will be copied 
and passed as argument, and no change will be visible at the caller side.

> Use vector<char>& zodis1 instead



##  1.0.4 casting

- static_cast
    - any well-defined type conversion, other than those involving low-level const
- dynamic_cast
    - supports the run-time type identification
    - 继承
- const_cast
    - changes only a low-level const in its operand
- reinterpret_cast
    -  performs a low-level reinterpretation of the bit pattern of its operands

## 1.0.5.C++ , size of int, long, short

### decided by compiler
- depends on the compiler and only on the compiler.
- Hardware/OS is of no importance at all
- The compiler is free to implement a hardware abstraction layer of any thickness and emulate absolutely anything

### char , byte, octet
- char is always a byte , but it's not always an octet
    - byte
        - A byte is the smallest addressable unit of memory (in most definitions), 
    - octet
        - an octet is 8-bit unit of memory
- sizeof(char) is always 1 for all implementations
- CHAR_BIT macro in limits.h
    - defines the size of a byte for a platform 
    - it is not always 8 bit.
        - 16-bit, 32-bit bytes
        - others[ex. 7], have to deal with aligned and padding

### size
- range
    - signed char: -127 to 127 (note, not -128 to 127; this accommodates 1's-complement and sign-and-magnitude platforms)
    - unsigned char: 0 to 255
    - "plain" char: same range as signed char or unsigned char, implementation-defined
    - signed short: -32767 to 32767
    - unsigned short: 0 to 65535
    - signed int: -32767 to 32767
    - unsigned int: 0 to 65535
    - signed long: -2147483647 to 2147483647
    - unsigned long: 0 to 4294967295
    - signed long long: -9223372036854775807 to 9223372036854775807
    - unsigned long long: 0 to 18446744073709551615
- rules
    - char, signed char, and unsigned char are at least 8 bits
    - signed short, unsigned short, signed int, and unsigned int are at least 16 bits
    - signed long and unsigned long are at least 32 bits
    - signed long long and unsigned long long are at least 64 bits

##  3.const--use const whenever possible

### type declaration before or after const are the same

> tips: read from right to left

```c++
//type declaration before or after const are the same

//tips: read from right to left
int const *ptr; //ptr is a pointer to constant int
const int *ptr1; //prt1 is a pointer to an int who is constant

int *const ptr3; //ptr3 is a const pointer to an int

//both ptr4 and ptr5 are constant pointer to a constant int
int const *const ptr4;
const int *const ptr5;
```

### stl iterators are modeled on pointers
> tips: read from left to right

```c++
    //const pointer
    const std::vector<int>::iterator iter = vec.begin();
    *iter = 10; //ok
    //++iter; //error

    //pointer to const data
    std::vector<int>::const_iterator clter = vec.begin();
//     *clter = 10; //error
    ++clter;   //ok
```

### Declaring something const helps compilers detect usage errors. 
- const can be applied to objects at any scope, 
    - function parameters 
    - return types, 
    - member functions as a whole.


## 4.make sure that objects are initialized before used

### initialized is not guaranteed

```c++
int x; //guaranteed to be initialized to zero

class Point {
    int x, y;
};
Point p; // p's data members are sometimes guaranteed sometimes are not
```
- rules are complicated(not worth)
    - in the c part of c++ , initialization would incur a runtime cost, not guaranteed
        - array isn't guaranteed to be initialized
    - non-c parts of c++, might be guaranteed
        - a std::vector is guaranteed to be initialized

### not confuse assignment with initialization
- assignment : inside the body of constructor
- initializatio took place earlier
    - default constructors were automatically called prior to entering the body
    - but built-in type
        - no constuctor/destructor
        - no guarantee it was initialized prior to its assignment
- The rules of C++ stipulate that data members of an object are initialized before the body of a constructor is entered

> use the member initialization list instead of assignments

```c++
//ex.
ABEntry::ABEntry(const std::string& name, const std::string& address,
const std::list<PhoneNumber>& phones)
//these are now all initializations
: theName(name), // copy-constructed
theAddress(address), //  copy-constructed
thePhones(phones),//  copy-constructed
numTimesConsulted(0)
{} // the ctor body is now empty

// use the member initialization list even when you want to default-construct a data member
ABEntry::ABEntry()
: theName(), // call theName’s default ctor;
theAddress(), // do the same for theAddress;
thePhones(), // and for thePhones;
numTimesConsulted(0) // but explicitly initialize
{} // numTimesConsulted to zero
```

- more efficient
    - assigiment first called default constructors then assigned new value
        - all the deafult constructors' work are wasted
    - member initialization list avoids it
        - arguments in the initialization list are used as constructor arguments for the various data members
            - For most types, a single call to a copy constructor is more efficient — sometimes much more efficient — than a call to the default constructor followed by a call to the copy assignment operator
            - for  built-it types, no different between initialization and assignment
                - for consistency, use member initialization too.
            - Sometimes the initialization list must be used,, even for built-in types.
                - For example, data members that are const or are references must be initialized; they can’t be assigned
    - if too much data members
        - multiple initialization lists introduces undesirable repetition (in the lists) and boredom
        - moving the assignments to a single (typically private) function that all the constructors call

### order of data initialization
- base classes are initialized before derived classes 
- and within a class,data members are initialized in the order in which they are declared
    - even if they are listed in a different order on the member initialization list
    - to avoid confusion: list members in the initialization list in the same order as they’re declared in the class

### staitc object
- A static object is one that exists from the time it’s constructed until the end of the program. 
    - excluded:Stack and heap-based objects 
    - Included are 
        - global objects, 
        - objects defined at namespace scope,
        - objects declared static inside classes, 
        - objects declared static inside functions, 
        - objects declared static at file scope

#### problem
- the relative order of initialization of nonlocal static objects defined in different translation units is undefined
- it’s not only impossible to determine the right order of initialization,
- it’s typically not even worth looking for special cases where it is possible to determine the right order.

#### solution: replaced non-local static objects with local static objects.
- move each non-local static object into its own function, where it’s declared static
    - Singleton pattern
- This approach is founded on C++’s guarantee that local static objects are initialized when the object’s definition is first encountered during a call to that function.
-  As a bonus, if you never call a function emulating a non-local static object, you never incur the cost of constructing and destructing the object, 
    - something that can’t be said for true non-local static objects
- might cause multi-theads problem
    - one solution is to manually invoke all the reference-returning functions during the single-threaded startup portion of the program.

## 5.funcitons c++ silently writes and calls
- default constructor,  copy constructor, destructor,  copy assignment operator(=)
	- copy constructor,  =
		-  simply copy each non-static data member
			- class for its own copy construtor
			- primitive just copy bits  
		-  compiler won't generate constructor if written constructors manually
			-  neither for others
-  generated only if they are needed

## 6.Explicitly disallow the use of compiler generated functions you do not want

> ex. avoid to copy

-  the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator are declared private and are not defined
-  change to compile error
	- use a base class:  Uncopyable

```c++
class Uncopyable {
protected: // allow construction
	Uncopyable() {} // and destruction of
	~Uncopyable() {} // derived objects...
private:
	Uncopyable(const Uncopyable&); // ...but prevent copying
	Uncopyable& operator=(const Uncopyable&);
};
```

## 7.virtual destructor
- problem: when a derived class object is deleted through a pointer to a base class with a non-virtual destructor, results are undefined.
	- tipicially, the derived part is never destroyed
	- leading to partialy destroyed object  

- but
	-  gratuitously[无偿的, 免费的] declaring all destructors virtual is wrong
		- increase the size
	- should not inherent from any class lacking a virtual destructor--**not designed to be used polymorphically**
		- std::string
		- stl containers: vector, list, set, tr1::unordered_map
		-  C++ offers no derivation-prevention mechanism
			-  java final
			-  c# sealed class

- solution:  give the base class a virtual destructor.
	-  destroy the entire object
	-  should  provide a body for the destructor
    - how it work:
        - the most derived classes's destructor is called first
        - then the destructor of eache base class is called

```
class AWOV { // AWOV = “Abstract w/o Virtuals”
public:
virtual ~AWOV() = 0; // declare pure virtual destructor
};

AWOV::~AWOV() {} // definition of pure virtual dtor
```

## 8.Prevent exceptions from leaving destructors.
- Destructors should never emit exceptions.
    - swallow it
    - terminate the program: std::abort()
- If class clients need to be able to react to exceptions thrown during
an operation,
    - server swallow the exception, and mark the exception with var
    - client check the var, and continue to solve it
