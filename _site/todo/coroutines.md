# coroutines

## concurrent vs parallel

> every parallel program is concurrent, but the converse is not necessarily true

- concurrent
	- two or more actions in progress at the same time.
	- a program-structuring technique
	- concerned only with efficiency
- parallel
	- two or more actions executing simultaneously
	- uses a multiplicity of computational hardware(多核cpu)
